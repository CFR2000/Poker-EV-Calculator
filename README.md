# Poker-EV-HUD
This GitHub project is focused on building an EV Heads Up Display (HUD) for the popular card game Texas Holdem using the Python programming language. The HUD is a tool that allows players to keep track of their opponents' statistics and tendencies during a game, which can help them make more informed decisions. This project aims to create a lightweight and user-friendly HUD that can be easily integrated into existing Texas Holdem software. The Python code will be well-documented and accompanied by instructions on how to set up and use the HUD. This project will be beneficial for Texas Holdem players who want to improve their game by gaining a competitive edge.
