# Poker-EV-HUD
This GitHub project is focused on building an EV Heads Up Display (HUD) for the popular card game Texas Holdem using the Python programming language. The HUD is a tool that allows players to keep track of their opponents' statistics and tendencies during a game, which can help them make more informed decisions. This project aims to create a lightweight and user-friendly HUD that can be easily integrated into existing Texas Holdem software. The Python code will be well-documented and accompanied by instructions on how to set up and use the HUD. This project will be beneficial for Texas Holdem players who want to improve their game by gaining a competitive edge.


### Structured Organisation of Poker EV Calculator
1. card.py: This file should contain the implementation of the Card class.
2. hand.py: This file should contain the implementation of the Hand class.
3. deck.py: This file should contain the implementation of the Deck class.
4. ev_calculations.py: This file should contain the implementation of the determine_best_hand, calculate_ev, and calculate_raise_amount functions.
5. gto_strategy.py: This file should contain the implementation of the calculate_gto_strategy and update_gto_strategy functions.
6. game_loop.py: This file should contain the implementation of the game loop that initializes the game state, prompts the player for an action, updates  the game state and GTO strategy, and executes the GTO strategy.
7. main.py: This file should contain the code to run the Poker EV calculation program. It should import the necessary classes and functions from the other files and call the functions to initialize the game and start the game loop.
